# Exercises

## 1. Experiment with Tailwind

You may decide it isn't for you, but take some time to try out Tailwind and design a few pages or components using it.

## 2. Create a Footer

Many websites include a footer with information like the copyright, links to various pages within the site, links to related communities, and more. Check out a few of your favorite sites, look for their footer, and try to create something similar for your app. This will give you practice with both templates and using Tailwind.

## 3. Explore Go's embed package

Read the [embed docs](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) and try to think about other ways you might be able to use the package.
