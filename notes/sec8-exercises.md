# Section 8 Exercises

## Ex1 - Experiment With Form Fields

We added a few inputs to our form, but it is worth adding a few more to make sure you understood everything we did.

For this exercise you can use the signup page, or create a new page entirely, but your goal is to add new inputs to a form, then use them to submit data to your server and try to parse them on the server.

If you want to get really complex, you could try looking at various input types. Eg a checkbox, or if you are feeling really ambitious you could even try to look at the [file type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file).

If you get stuck at any point don't worry - we will continue creating forms as we progress and will eventually support file uploads. This is meant to be a chance to experiment and push yourself outside your comfort zone.

## Ex2 - Adjust Your Paths

In at attempt to make sure you understand everything, try to alter the paths of a few of our endpoints. For instance, change the signup page to instead be located at `/users/new` and see what all needs to be changed to make this happen.

Alternatively, try alternating the user create endpoint between `POST /signup` and `POST /users` to see what is required to make this happen.
