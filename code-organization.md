#CODE Organization

-Some codebases are easy to navigate
-Others are hard to follow
-Code  organization is often the difference 

A good code structure will :
-Make it easier to guess where bugs are
-Make it easier to add new features
-And more

## Flat Structure

All code in single packge 
Files can still seperate code :


```
myapp/
    gallery_store.go
    gallery_handler.go
    gallery_templates.go
    user_store.go
    user_handler.go
    user_templates.go
    royter.go
    ...
```
